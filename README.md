# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.
My name is Noah Campbell Gallegos, 

In lab we learned how to use GitHub Desktop and add code to our repositories and also change code inside the repository.

I think GitHub Desktop is the most valuable because its the most easily accessible and can upload to the website version as well.

The overall use for Git is to allow individuals to use its control features collaboratively with the web-based platform and enable users to save snapshots of projects ovetime.
